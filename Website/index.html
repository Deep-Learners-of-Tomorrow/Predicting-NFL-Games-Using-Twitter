							<h3><i class="ti-light-bulb"></i> Motivation</h3>
							<p>Attempting to predict the outcomes of athletic contests is a process as old as sports themselves, but up until now, most models relied on hard statistics about the players and teams involved without taking into consideration how the fans might play a part in the process. Our goal as a team was to see if utilizing data from social media, specifically Twitter, could help a neural network predict the outcomes of NFL football games. Harnessing ‘the wisdom of the  crowds’ is not a new idea and has been used to help other models predict major events like stock market fluctuations and disease outbreaks, but we believe it could hold important insights into how a team will perform in a contest whether its a direct result of their fan’s support through motivation, or a proxy measure of overall performance game to game.</p>

							<h3><i class="ti-settings"></i> Technical Overview</h3>
							<p>Our research combines two previous predictive models into one. We started with an artificial neural network specifically designed to use NFL team statistics to predict game outcomes, using the same statistics and network structure. We then used tweets from a different model to create two new features for our network; tweet rate, which was a borrowed metric from the twitter model that measured the change in total tweets about a team week to week, and crowd sentiment, our own metric which used the average polarity (positive or negative attitude) of all fan tweets about a given team each week to create a unified score.

							<h3><i class="ti-paint-roller"></i> Development/Testing</h3>
							<p>The bulk of the overhead development came in the form of data collection and cleaning. We used the python package sportsreference to gather the NFL statistics used to create the majority of the features for our model. For the twitter data, we used the python package tweepy to pull tweets from a list of tweet IDs provided by the authors of the predictive twitter model. We then used VADER to perform the sentiment analysis. Our neural network was developed and tested using pytorch lightning through Google Colab. We kept the same network structure as the NFL stats model used for inspiration, but in order to find the correct batch size and training time we tested our model at </p>

										<p>These graphs show the loss and accuracy over the training and validation sets for the best tuned models we could come up with for both the statistic and twitter nets. The twitter net was able to learn much faster, as the loss and accuracy both converged at around 300 training steps. The stats net took longer to learn but got to better loss and accuracy values in the end on the test and validation sets. When we ran over our test set, the twitter and stats net had 65.9% and 60% accuracy respectively. We believe that this is due to the twitter net being able to better generalize results as 3 years of football games is only 672 total examples and it is likely that the stats net was overfit to the training data. This means that the twitter net beats the 63.8% accuracy of the paper we got our inspiration from and is close to the average accuracy of the very best nets for the same three year period (69% via the predictiontracker.com)</p>
